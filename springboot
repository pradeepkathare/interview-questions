where is http request first comes to and who takes control to it?
  In a Spring Boot application, when an HTTP request is received, it first goes through the following sequence:
  Server Socket: The request is received by the server socket, which is typically managed by the embedded servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) in a Spring Boot application.
  Servlet Container: The servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) receives the request and creates an HttpServletRequest object to represent the request.
  DispatcherServlet: The DispatcherServlet is the main servlet in Spring MVC that handles incoming requests. It's responsible for delegating the request to the appropriate handler (e.g., controller method).
  Here's a high-level overview of the request processing flow:
  Server Socket → Servlet Container (e.g., Tomcat)
  Servlet Container → DispatcherServlet
  DispatcherServlet → Handler Mapping (e.g., @RequestMapping)
  Handler Mapping → Controller Method (e.g., @GetMapping, @PostMapping)
  Controller Method → Service Layer (optional)
  Service Layer → Repository Layer (optional)
  Repository Layer → Database (optional)
  Controller Method → DispatcherServlet (returns response)
  DispatcherServlet → Servlet Container (returns response to client)

How DispatcherServlet Configured
  The DispatcherServlet is the central component that takes control of the request and delegates it to the appropriate handler. It's responsible for:
  Mapping the request to a handler (e.g., controller method)
  Invoking the handler and handling any exceptions that may occur
  Returning the response to the client
  In a Spring Boot application, the DispatcherServlet is automatically 
  configured and registered with the servlet container. You can customize its behavior by using various configuration options and annotations 
  (e.g., @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping).
